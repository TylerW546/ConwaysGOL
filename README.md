# ConwaysGOL
An implementation of Conway's Game of Life using Java and a DrawingPanel class (which I only made a few edits to from the existing online code).

# Keybinds:

Scroll to zoom in/out
P to pause
U to unpause
WASD to move around
Click to manually invert a square, can't click and drag though (some bugs were happening when I tried to make it so you could)
1 to fill square at mouse cursor, can hold it and drag the mouse to draw
2 to kill square at mouse cursor
